# tachi-scripts

This repository contains scripts I have written to export scores from various places in the tachi format. To get started, add these scripts **Tampermonkey** (and **NOT** Greasemonkey) and you should find an export button when visiting your profile.

## Setting up for dummies

0. Install Tampermonkey ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo))
1. Click on the script you'd like to install, then `Raw`. If Tampermonkey opens and asks you to install the script, you're good to go! If not, continue below.
2. Copy the script (Select All, Copy)
3. Open Tampermonkey's menu, then click on `Add a new script`.
4. Paste the script, save it using the dropdown menu or `Ctrl` + `S`.

If you have done everything correctly, the script should have a name and an icon that you should recognize. If not, delete it and start over. If you do not see the button, restart your browser.
