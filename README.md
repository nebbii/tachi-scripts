# tachi-scripts

This repository contains scripts I have written to export scores from various places in the tachi format. To get started, add these scripts **Tampermonkey** (and **NOT** Greasemonkey) and you should find an export button when visiting your profile.

## Credits

- Original script credits goes to Humanbomb. [Script](https://gist.github.com/vmichalak/7fb3084260b0bf646a36b74eff823d69)

This script was made for jubeat, but you should use Meta's improved script.

- Modified version with multiple page scraping by Meta-link. [Script](https://gist.github.com/Meta-link/d01c15fc56a277becc7d67a7c1dccfa2)

This script supports jubeat and MUSECA.

## Setting up for dummies

0. Install Tampermonkey ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo))
1. Click on the script you'd like to install, then `Raw`.
2. Copy the script (Select All, Copy)
3. Open Tampermonkey's menu, then click on `Add a new script`.
4. Paste the script, save it using the dropdown menu or `Ctrl` + `S`.

If you have done everything correctly, the script should have a name and an icon that you should recognize. If not, delete it and start over. If you do not see the button, restart your browser.
